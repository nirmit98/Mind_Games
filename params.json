At 12 midnight the hands are exactly aligned. When is the next time(precise upto seconds) they will exactly align or overlap? How many times a day will they overlap?\r\n### Puzzle 4\r\nAn executioner lines up 100 prisoners single file and puts a red or a blue hat on each prisoner's head. Every prisoner can see the hats of the people in front of him in the line - but not his own hat, nor those of anyone behind him. The executioner starts at the end (back) and asks the last prisoner the colour of his hat. He must answer \"red\" or \"blue.\" If he answers correctly, he is allowed to live. If he gives the wrong answer, he is killed instantly and silently. (While everyone hears the answer, no one knows whether an answer was right.) On the night before the line-up, the prisoners confer on strategy to help them. What should they do?\r\n### Puzzle 5\r\nA man is in a rowing boat floating on a lake, in the boat he has a brick(that doesn't absorb water). He throws the brick over the side of the boat so as it lands in the water. The brick sinks quickly. The question is, as a result of this does the water level in the lake go up or down?<hr>",
