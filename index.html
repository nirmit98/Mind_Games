<img src="https://prismoskills.appspot.com/lessons/Brain_Teasers/imgs/run.png" alt="Speed"> <br>
But the bridge is very shaky and cannot support more than 2 people on it.Also, its dark and the bridge travellers must carry a torch (the torch can't be thrown &amp; it can light only a short area of path).What is the minimum time in which these 4 people can cross the bridge?<br>
<strong>Hint:</strong> A pair will walk at the speed of the slowest one.</p>

<p>An executioner lines up 100 prisoners single file and puts a red or a blue hat on each prisoner's head. Every prisoner can see the hats of the people in front of him in the line - but not his own hat, nor those of anyone behind him. The executioner starts at the end (back) and asks the last prisoner the colour of his hat. He must answer "red" or "blue." If he answers correctly, he is allowed to live. If he gives the wrong answer, he is killed instantly and silently. (While everyone hears the answer, no one knows whether an answer was right.) On the night before the line-up, the prisoners confer on strategy to help them. What should they do?</p>
